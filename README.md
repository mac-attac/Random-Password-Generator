## Random-Password-Generator

In today's day and age, password security is everything. Including the same password for everything can be like have one key to your house, car, and security deposit box. It's incredibly vital to have excellent password integrity. This repository houses a web application for randomly generating a password with your choice of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.

## The Repository

After visiting the site and clicking the Generate Password button, the user will be prompted with a series of prompts where they can specify length and the type of characters included in their password. It is then available for copy and paste after generating in a read-only text box. The end result can be seen here:

This was an excellent learning opportunity for me to take my vanilla JavaScript skills and put them to the test. The .js file utilizes most of the basic elements of the language and made use of some methods that required some research on my part.

## Feedback

Feedback can be provided in the comments if there is something incorrect in terms of syntax. I know my code might not be the prettiest, so please take it easy.
